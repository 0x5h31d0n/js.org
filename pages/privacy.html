<h2 id="place_of_processing">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
<h3>Methods of processing</h3>
<p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
    unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
    tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
    Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation
    of JS.ORG (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party
    technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if
    necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any
    time.</p>
<h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
<p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
        allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely
        on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
        Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
        obligations thereof;</li>

    <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
        authority vested in the Owner;</li>
    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
    particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
    necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
<h3>Place</h3>
<p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the
    processing are located.<br /><br /> Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the
    User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
    Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
<p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or
    to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as
    the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br /> If any such transfer
    takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner
    using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
<h3>Retention time</h3>
<p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>

        shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
    <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed
        to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the
        Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
    processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data
    for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
    authority.<br /><br /> Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of
    access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
    expiration of the retention period.</p>
<h2 id="use_collected_data">The purposes of processing</h2>
<p> The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal
    obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or third
    parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Hosting and backend infrastructure,
    Traffic optimization and distribution, Advertising and Displaying content from external platforms. </p>

<h2 id="data_processing_detailed_info">Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data</h2>
<p>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and using the following services:</p>
<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>This type of service allows User Data to be utilized for advertising communication purposes. These communications are
    displayed in the form of banners and other advertisements on JS.ORG, possibly based on User interests.<br /> This
    does not mean that all Personal Data are used for this purpose. Information and conditions of use are shown below.
    <br /> Some of the services listed below may use Trackers to identify Users or they may use the behavioral
    retargeting technique, i.e. displaying ads tailored to the User’s interests and behavior, including those detected
    outside JS.ORG. For more information, please check the privacy policies of the relevant services.<br /> Services of
    this kind usually offer the possibility to opt out of such tracking. In addition to any opt-out feature offered by
    any of the services below, Users may learn more on how to generally opt out of interest-based advertising within the
    dedicated section "How to opt-out of interest-based advertising" in this document.</p>

<p>This type of service has the purpose of hosting Data and files that enable JS.ORG to run and be distributed as well
    as to provide a ready-made infrastructure to run specific features or parts of JS.ORG. Some of these services work
    through geographically distributed servers, making it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal
    Data are stored.</p>

<p>This type of service allows JS.ORG to distribute their content using servers located across different countries and

    these services are implemented. Their function is to filter communications between JS.ORG and the User's
    browser.<br /> Considering the widespread distribution of this system, it is difficult to determine the locations to
    which the contents that may contain Personal Information of the User are transferred.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare (Cloudflare Inc.)</h4>
<p>Cloudflare is a traffic optimization and distribution service provided by Cloudflare Inc.<br /> The way Cloudflare is
    integrated means that it filters all the traffic through JS.ORG, i.e., communication between JS.ORG and the User's
